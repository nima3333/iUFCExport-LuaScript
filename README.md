# iUFCExport-LuaScript
Script for DCS (https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/) to export plane UFCs (or other panels)

## How to install
- Check if you already have a `Scripts` folder inside your DCS Saved Games folder. The usual path is `<your_home>\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts`.
  - If you don't, then create this `Scripts` folder.
- Go to that `Scripts` folder and check if you already have a file name `Export.lua`.
  - If you don't, copy the `Exports.lua` file provided in this project to your `Scripts` folder.
  - If you do, add the content of the `Exports.lua` file provided in this project to the end of the existing `Exports.lua`.
- Finally, copy the `iUFCExport.lua` file to your `Scripts` folder
